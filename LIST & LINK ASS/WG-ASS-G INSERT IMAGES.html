<p>The mosque is situated at the end of Shaharah-e-Islamabad, against the backdrop of the picturesque Margalla Hills.<br />
     This placement defines its importance, positioning it on elevated terraced land ensures its visibility during day <br />
     and night for miles around. The mosque is dedicated to the memory of the late King Faisal of Saudi Arabia who <br />
     graciously defrayed the cost of the project as a gift to the people of Pakistan.<br />
     The mosque at its inception was conceptualized as the national mosque of the newly formed Islamic nation and was <br />
     intended to symbolize the hopes and aspiration of Pakistan. The Turkish architect, Vedat Dalokay's design was selected<br />
      through an international competition.</p>

      <img src='minar.jpg' Alt="Minare pakistan" title="Minare-e-Pakistan". width="400" height="250" align="center" />
      <p>Minar-e-Pakistan, also translated as ‘Tower of Pakistan’ and ‘Minaret of Pakistan’ was built to commemorate Pakistan<br />
         Resolution (Lahore Resolution), which was adopted during the All India Muslim League session of 22-24 March, 1940, held<br />
         at the Minto Park (now renamed as the Greater Iqbal Park).<br />


        The Pakistan Resolution paved the way for creation of a separate state — Pakistan — for the Muslims of Northeast and<br />
         Northwest territories under British India. March 23, 1940, is an epoch-making day when the Muslims of India embarked<br />
         on a journey for a separate homeland. This day served as a true testament to the vision of Allama Dr Muhammad Iqbal, <br />
         the Poet of the East, who had claimed in his Presidential address at Allahabad in 1930, “India is a continent of human<br />
          groups, belonging to different races, speaking different languages, and professing different religions.</p>
